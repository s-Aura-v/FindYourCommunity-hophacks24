# Find your Community 
As people, we're fueled largely by our emotions. Our technology continues to harness our emotions in negative ways as its algorithm are catered to spread hate and disgust. Nothing spreads faster than hate, and nothing brings more profit than hate. Our web app, Find Your Community, allows people to host community service events, such as food banks, school events, and more, which can be easily accessed by the user. The main purpose of this webpage is to allow a seamless transition between hosting and joining an event because being a good person should not have to be difficult.
